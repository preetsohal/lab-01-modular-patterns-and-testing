as a developer
    You need to install node package and its dependencies globally.
    Once you install and initialize it.
    As a developer in order to perform test you need to need to install mocha and chai dependencies.
    You need to install dependencies for eslint through command line.
    I have created bunch of test tasks. you should be able to test it by typing mocha in command line.
