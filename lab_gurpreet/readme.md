as a developer
    i want to install package.json file globally.
    i need to include test file under test directory in order to perform tests.
    i need to install node eslint in order to test my tasks.
    i need to include all node project related dependencies such as node mocha,  chai etc.
    i want to run mocha test and eslint test in command line to make sure it passes the lint test and mocha test.
